    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>My name is Amanda Torres Rubio!</h2>
    <p>
      I am from San Juan, PRðŸ‡µðŸ‡· living in Pittsburgh, PAðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ with my husband and
      four kids. We decided to move to USA after hurricane Maria hit the island
      back in 2017. I am 30 years old and love learning new things daily. I am
      fully billingual in Spanish and English. Spanish being my first language.
      I love the japanese culture and everything manga and anime related. In
      this moment in my life I am focus on my happiness and on growing.

      I been a star at home mom for the past couple of years. My kids are all in
      school now and I feel prepared to go back to work. I discovered computer
      science, web developing, web design recently but I can say with the
      outmost certanty that this is what I was meant to do! I love how you need
      to use your critical brain to code but also your creativity to design
      beautiful and attractive websites that the users would like to consume. I
      started just being a little curios about women in tech and then I found a
      program called SheCodes that offered a free 60 minutes coding class and I
      was hooked!
